## Project Setup & Submission Guidelines

> ⚠️ **Read this section carefully before writing a single line of code. Your submission will not be reviewed if these instructions are not followed.**

### 1. Create Your Eclipse Project

Create a new Java project in Eclipse with the following naming format:

```
<your-firstname>-<your-lastname>-core-java-labs
```

**Examples:**

| Trainee Name | Project Name |
|---|---|
| Sonu Pande | `sonu-pande-core-java-labs` |
| Amit Kumar | `amit-kumar-core-java-labs` |
| Priya Sharma | `priya-sharma-core-java-labs` |

> Use only lowercase letters and hyphens. No spaces or underscores in the project name.

### 2. Package Naming Convention

Each exercise must live in its **own package**. The package name must follow this pattern:

```
com.<firstname>.lab<lab_number>.ex<exercise_number>
```

**Examples:**

| Exercise | Package |
|---|---|
| Lab 1, Exercise 1 | `com.sonu.lab1.ex1` |
| Lab 1, Exercise 5 | `com.sonu.lab1.ex5` |
| Lab 2, Exercise 3 | `com.sonu.lab2.ex3` |
| Lab 6, Exercise 4 | `com.sonu.lab6.ex4` |

> Use your **first name only** (lowercase) in the package name. If your first name has spaces or special characters, remove them. Example: *Sonu Pande* → `com.sonu`.

### 3. Class Naming

Each exercise should have at least one class. Name your main class descriptively based on what it does:

- **Good:** `CalculateSum`, `SortStrings`, `MirrorImage`
- **Avoid:** `Solution`, `Main`, `Test`, `Exercise1`

For exercises that require a driver/test class, name it `<ClassName>Runner` or `<ClassName>Test`. Example: `CalculateSumRunner`.

### 4. Expected Project Structure

Your project should look like this inside Eclipse (Package Explorer):

```
sonu-pande-core-java-labs/
└── src/
    ├── com/sonu/lab1/ex1/          ← Lab 1, Exercise 1
    │   └── SumOfCubes.java
    ├── com/sonu/lab1/ex5/          ← Lab 1, Exercise 5
    │   ├── CalculateSum.java
    │   └── CalculateSumRunner.java
    ├── com/sonu/lab2/ex1/          ← Lab 2, Exercise 1
    │   └── SecondSmallest.java
    ├── com/sonu/lab3/ex2/          ← Lab 3, Exercise 2
    │   └── MirrorImage.java
    ...
```

> For Labs 4 and 7 (which span multiple classes in a layered structure), keep all classes for that lab under a shared base package: `com.sonu.lab4` and `com.sonu.lab7`, with sub-packages as prescribed in the exercise (e.g., `com.sonu.lab7.bean`, `com.sonu.lab7.service`, `com.sonu.lab7.pl`).

### 5. Sharing Your Work

Once you have completed your exercises (or at the end of each day), share your project with the trainer by following these steps:

1. **Right-click** your project in Eclipse → **Export** → **General** → **Archive File**.
2. Name the archive exactly as your project: e.g., `sonu-pande-core-java-labs.zip`.
3. Share the `.zip` file with the trainer via the agreed channel (email / shared drive / Teams).

> Alternatively, if the batch uses a shared GitHub/GitLab repository, push your project to a branch named after you: e.g., `sonu-pande`. **Do not push to `main`.**

### 6. Checklist Before Submitting

Before sharing your work, make sure:

- [ ] Project name follows the `<firstname>-<lastname>-core-java-labs` format.
- [ ] Every exercise is in its own package (`com.<firstname>.lab<n>.ex<n>`).
- [ ] All classes follow Java naming conventions (see [Appendix A](#appendix-a-naming-conventions)).
- [ ] All mandatory exercises are attempted.
- [ ] Code compiles without errors.
- [ ] You have added a brief comment at the top of each class explaining what it does.
- [ ] No hardcoded paths (e.g., `C:\Users\sonu\...`) that only work on your machine.

## General Coding Guidelines

Good habits from day one will make you a better developer. Follow these guidelines across all exercises:

### Write Clean Code

- Use **meaningful variable names**: `sum`, `count`, `studentName` — not `x`, `temp`, `s1`.
- Keep methods **short and focused** — one method should do one thing.
- **Avoid magic numbers** — instead of `if (age > 18)`, declare `final int VOTING_AGE = 18`.
- Add a **brief Javadoc comment** on each method explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value:
  ```java
  /**
   * Calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers divisible by 3 or 5.
   * @param n the upper limit
   * @return the sum
   */
  public int calculateSum(int n) { ... }
  ```

### Handle Edge Cases

Always think about what could go wrong:

- What if the input array is `null` or empty?
- What if `n` is 0 or negative?
- What if the user enters a non-integer where an integer is expected?

Where applicable, validate inputs and handle them gracefully with a meaningful message or exception.

### Use the Right Data Structure

| Situation | Prefer |
|---|---|
| Ordered, allows duplicates | `ArrayList` |
| No duplicates, unsorted | `HashSet` |
| No duplicates, sorted | `TreeSet` |
| Key-value pairs, fast lookup | `HashMap` |
| Key-value pairs, sorted keys | `TreeMap` |
| LIFO (stack behaviour) | `Deque` / `ArrayDeque` |
| FIFO (queue behaviour) | `Queue` / `LinkedList` |

### Test Your Code

Don't just run the happy path. For every method you write, test at least:

- A **normal case** — typical expected input.
- A **boundary case** — e.g., `n = 0`, empty array, single-element array.
- An **invalid/edge case** — negative number, null string, etc.

Create a `Runner` class with a `main` method that calls your method with multiple test inputs and prints the results. Example:

```java
public class CalculateSumRunner {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CalculateSum cs = new CalculateSum();
        System.out.println(cs.calculateSum(10));  // Expected: 33
        System.out.println(cs.calculateSum(0));   // Expected: 0
        System.out.println(cs.calculateSum(1));   // Expected: 0
    }
}
```

### Exception Handling Best Practices

- **Never swallow exceptions silently**: avoid `catch (Exception e) {}` with an empty body.
- Print a meaningful message or re-throw when catching exceptions.
- Use **specific exception types** (`NumberFormatException`, `IllegalArgumentException`) rather than catching generic `Exception` unless necessary.
- Use `finally` for cleanup (closing streams, connections), or better yet, use **try-with-resources**:
  ```java
  try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
      // read file
  } catch (IOException e) {
      System.err.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
  }
  ```

### Java 8 Specific Tips

- Prefer **enhanced for-each loops** over indexed loops when you don't need the index.
- Use **`String.format()`** or **`StringBuilder`** instead of `+` concatenation inside loops.
- When working with `Optional` (from Stream API): always check with `isPresent()` or use `orElse()` before accessing the value.
- Lambda expressions are concise — but if a lambda body is more than 2–3 lines, extract it into a named method and use a **method reference** instead.
- For sorting with `Comparator`, prefer the fluent API:
  ```java
  list.sort(Comparator.comparing(Employee::getSalary).reversed());
  ```

## Before You Start

Here are some tips to make problem-solving easier:

1. Always check if there are direct API methods available to solve the question easily.
2. Use `Collections.sort()` to sort an `ArrayList`. For arrays, convert them first and then sort.
3. Converting numeric data types to `String` can help solve some problems — e.g., use `charAt()` to compare first digits or to reverse digits of a number.
4. To remove duplicates from an array, convert it to a `Set`. If sorted order is also needed, use `TreeSet`.
5. Try to use Collection, String, and Wrapper APIs wherever possible.
6. While using any API method, explore the other methods in the same API — they may help with other problems.
7. The hints provided are only suggestions. You can use your own algorithm/logic to solve each problem.

## Appendix A: Naming Conventions

### Packages

Package names are written in **all lowercase** to avoid conflict with class or interface names. Companies use their reversed Internet domain name as a prefix — e.g., `com.cg.mypackage`. Packages in the Java language itself begin with `java.` or `javax.`.

### Classes and Interfaces

The first letter should be **capitalized**. If multiple words are combined, each inner word should be capitalized (camelCase).

- **Classes** — names should typically be **nouns**:
  - `Dog`
  - `Account`
  - `PrintWriter`

- **Interfaces** — names should typically be **adjectives**:
  - `Runnable`
  - `Serializable`

### Methods

The first letter should be **lowercase**, followed by camelCase. Names should typically be **verb-noun pairs**:

- `getBalance`
- `doCalculation`
- `setCustomerName`

### Variables

Use **camelCase** starting with a lowercase letter. Keep names short and meaningful:

- `buttonWidth`
- `accountBalance`
- `myString`

### Constants

Constants are `static final` variables and should be named in **UPPERCASE with underscores** as separators:

- `MIN_HEIGHT`
